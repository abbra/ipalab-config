# The docker compose spec does not allow disabling the internal DNS
# nameserver for user defined networks, or setting the network DNS
# resolver. This may cause conflicts when complete control of DNS
# zones (direct and reverse) is needed.
#
# By allowing the usage of a pre-existing network, the network can be
# created with the required configuration.
#
# To use this example, first create a network with:
#     `podman network create --subnet "192.168.12.0/24" my_external_network
#
# Note that 'subnet' must be provided and must match the value used to
# create the external network.
